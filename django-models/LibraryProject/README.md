# LibraryProject

This is the initial setup for the Django project named LibraryProject. It was created using Django's startproject command and will serve as the foundation for developing Django applications.

## Structure
- `manage.py`: Command-line utility to interact with the project.
- `LibraryProject/settings.py`: Main configuration for the Django project.
- `LibraryProject/urls.py`: URL declarations for the project.
- `LibraryProject/wsgi.py` and `asgi.py`: Entry points for WSGI/ASGI-compatible web servers.

## Getting Started
To run the development server:

```bash
C:/Users/emmun/projects/Alx_DjangoLearnLab/.venv/Scripts/python.exe manage.py runserver
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser to view the default Django welcome page.
