# AWS Deployment Guide for Social Media API

This guide walks through preparing, deploying, and operating the `social_media_api` Django project on Amazon Web Services using Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, and S3. Follow each section carefully to ensure a secure and reliable production environment.

> **Live URL**: `https://<your-env-name>.elasticbeanstalk.com` (replace after launching the environment).

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- AWS account with AdministratorAccess (for initial setup). Drop privileges to least-permission roles afterwards.
- AWS CLI v2 installed and configured with credentials: `aws configure`.
- Elastic Beanstalk CLI (`pip install awsebcli`).
- Docker (optional but useful for local parity tests).
- GitHub repository access for CI/CD (optional but recommended).

---

## 2. Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in the Elastic Beanstalk console (Configuration â†’ Software) or via the EB CLI (`eb setenv`). Use secure storage (AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store) for sensitive values and reference them in EB.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | Production secret key. Generate with `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))"` |
| `DJANGO_DEBUG` | Set to `False` |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated hostnames (e.g., `your-env.elasticbeanstalk.com,your.custom.domain`) |
| `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated HTTPS origins (e.g., `https://your.custom.domain`) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | RDS connection string (`postgres://user:password@hostname:5432/dbname`) |
| `DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE` | (Optional) Keep-alive seconds, e.g., `120` |
| `DATABASE_SSL_REQUIRE` | `True` to enforce TLS to RDS |
| `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` | S3 bucket for static/media content |
| `AWS_S3_REGION_NAME` | Bucket region, e.g., `us-east-1` |
| `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` | (Optional) CloudFront domain serving the bucket |
| `AWS_S3_STATIC_LOCATION` | Prefix for collected static files, default `static` |
| `AWS_S3_MEDIA_LOCATION` | Prefix for uploaded media, default `media` |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | IAM user or role credentials with S3 access (if not using instance profile) |
| `DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` | `True` to enforce HTTPS (default) |
| `DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level, e.g., `INFO` |
| `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, etc. | Configure if outbound email is required |

> Configure IAM instance profiles or Secrets Manager wherever possible so you do not inject long-term credentials directly.

## 3. AWS Infrastructure Overview

1. **Elastic Beanstalk (EB)** â€“ Python 3.11 platform running Gunicorn behind nginx.
2. **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** â€“ Production database in the same VPC as EB.
3. **Amazon S3** â€“ Stores static assets (`collectstatic`) and uploaded media. Optionally front with **Amazon CloudFront** CDN.
4. **Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)** â€“ Issues TLS certificates for HTTPS.
5. **AWS CloudWatch** â€“ Aggregates logs and metrics. Configure alarms on `5xx` responses, latency, CPU, and RDS health.

Create the VPC, security groups, and subnets (public for ALB, private for EB/RDS) if they do not already exist. Ensure the EB environment, RDS instance, and S3 bucket share the same region and VPC for low latency and security.

---

## 4. Project Preparation

1. **Install dependencies locally**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Collect static assets** (optional dry run)
   ```bash
   DJANGO_DEBUG=False DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=dummy python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```
3. **Commit deployment files**: `Procfile`, `runtime.txt`, `.ebextensions/01_django.config`, and this guide.
4. **Push to GitHub** if not already present.

---

## 5. Provision AWS Resources

### 5.1 Create the S3 Bucket

- Name: `social-media-api-prod-<unique>` (must be globally unique).
- Enable versioning and (optionally) default encryption.
- Update bucket policy to allow ELB/CloudFront access. Example policy granting public read of `static` objects:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::social-media-api-prod-<unique>/static/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Keep media objects private by default. Serve them via signed URLs if needed.

### 5.2 Launch RDS PostgreSQL

- Engine: PostgreSQL 15 or newer.
- Instance class: `db.t3.micro` (adjust for load).
- Storage: Start at 20 GB, GP3.
- Enable automatic backups, Multi-AZ (production), and Performance Insights.
- Set VPC security group to allow inbound traffic from the EB security group on port 5432.

Gather the connection endpoint, database name, username, and password to compose `DATABASE_URL`.

### 5.3 Create Elastic Beanstalk Environment

```bash
eb init --platform "Python 3.11" --region us-east-1 social-media-api
```

- Choose **Load Balanced, Scalable** environment.
- Configure capacity (minimum 1 instance; auto scaling as needed).
- Attach the RDS security group to allow outbound DB connections.
- Associate the S3 bucket as an environment property (`AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`).
- Add the IAM instance profile with S3/RDS access.

Deploy the application:

```bash
eb create social-media-api-prod --single
```

> The bundled `.ebextensions/01_django.config` runs database migrations and `collectstatic` during each deployment.

### 5.4 Configure HTTPS

1. Request a certificate via AWS Certificate Manager for your domain.
2. Attach the certificate to the Elastic Beanstalk load balancer listener (Configuration â†’ Load Balancer).
3. Ensure port 80 redirects to 443 (nginx handles this automatically; Django also enforces HTTPS via `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`).

### 5.5 Optional: CloudFront Distribution

- Create a distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin.
- Set alternate domain names (CNAMEs) and attach an ACM certificate.
- Point `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` to the CloudFront domain to leverage CDN caching.

---

## 6. Deployment Workflow

1. **Commit and push changes** to the `main` branch.
2. **Deploy with EB CLI**:
   ```bash
   eb deploy social-media-api-prod
   ```
3. **Run database migrations** (automated via `.ebextensions`). Trigger manually if required:
   ```bash
   eb ssh --command "python manage.py migrate --noinput"
   ```
4. **Seed data** (optional):
   ```bash
   eb ssh --command "python manage.py createsuperuser"
   ```

For CI/CD, integrate GitHub Actions with the `elasticbeanstalk-deploy` action. Ensure the workflow runs tests, builds the artifact, and calls `eb deploy` using IAM credentials scoped to Elastic Beanstalk.

## 7. Monitoring & Maintenance

| Task | Tooling | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application logs | Elastic Beanstalk console or `eb logs` (pipes to CloudWatch) | Ad hoc / on alert |
| Metrics & Alarms | CloudWatch dashboards, `5xx`, latency, CPU, RDS connections | Continuous |
| Security patches | Dependabot / `pip list --outdated` | Weekly |
| Database backups | Automated snapshots (configure retention) | Daily |
| Static asset invalidation | CloudFront cache invalidation after major releases | As needed |
| Health checks | EB environment health, ALB target status | Continuous |

Set up CloudWatch alarms to notify (SNS/Slack) when:
- `HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count` > 5 in 5 minutes.
- `Latency` p95 > 1s.
- `CPUUtilization` > 80% for 15 minutes.
- `DatabaseConnections` near the max configured.

Enable AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing if you need deeper diagnostics.

---

## 8. Disaster Recovery & Scaling

- **Scaling**: Configure Auto Scaling in EB to add instances when CPU or network IO exceeds thresholds.
- **Blue/Green Deployments**: Create a cloned environment, deploy there, validate, then swap CNAMEs.
- **Backups**: Store database snapshots and S3 lifecycle transitions to Glacier for long-term retention.
- **IaC**: Consider migrating to AWS CDK or Terraform to codify infrastructure.

---

## 9. Final Verification Checklist

- [ ] `DEBUG=False` and `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` configured correctly.
- [ ] Elastic Beanstalk deployment returns HTTP 200 on `/health/` or root endpoint.
- [ ] Static assets load from S3/CloudFront.
- [ ] File uploads succeed and appear in the S3 bucket under the media prefix.
- [ ] Migrations applied and admin login works over HTTPS.
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms and log streaming enabled.
- [ ] New relic/Sentry (optional) connected for error tracking.

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| `ImproperlyConfigured: SECRET_KEY` missing | Ensure `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` is set in EB environment |
| 502/504 errors from ALB | Check EB health dashboard, view logs (`eb logs`), verify Gunicorn boot |
| Static files return 403 | Update S3 bucket policy, confirm `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` and ACL settings |
| Database connection timeouts | Confirm security groups, use RDS `Database_URL` with SSL, verify `DATABASE_SSL_REQUIRE` |
| `collectstatic` failure on deploy | Ensure IAM role has `s3:PutObject` and `s3:ListBucket`, bucket exists |

---

## 11. Next Steps

- Add automated smoke tests hitting critical endpoints post-deploy.
- Wire up Sentry or AWS Error Reporting for exception monitoring.
- Configure GitHub Actions pipeline to run `python -m compileall`, `python -m pytest`, and `eb deploy`.
- Register a custom domain and update DNS A/AAAA records to the ALB alias.
